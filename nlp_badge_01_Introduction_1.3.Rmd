# Introduction to NLP

This notebook should only take you about a minute.

## What is a R Markdown notebook / file:

Each badge video will be accompanied by a notebook like this. In it you will find more in depth explanations of content you've watched and also some new ones. There will also be a lot of coding examples and tasks 

```{r}
# you can write your code here
# and you can run this code cell with shift+ctrl+Enter
# try it now:

paste("NLP","is","the","best", sep = "***")

someText <- "why ArE yOu WritTING iN sO mANy dIffERenT caSEs?"
paste(toupper(someText))

sprintf("%s", tolower(someText))
```
Sometimes coding tasks might be a bit tricky, in which case we will leave a number of hints for you. To open a hint, you need to click the link to file name below, while holding ctrl on a PC (or cmd on a mac). It opens a separate file with a hint.

[hint for task 01](./hints/hint_1_1.Rmd)

# Reflection:

Now is a good moment to write down your self reflection: think of 3
STARS (things that you learned in this badge), and 1 WISH: a thing you
wish you understood better. You might also thing of what would you do to
fulfil your wish. Write them down, and post them on Learn - preferably immediately after writing them, this will strengthen your learning.

Go to learn now, and write what you learned from the long badge 01 video and this notebook.

# Conclusion:

In very short badge has shown you the format of a markdown file which we will use to accompany content videos.
